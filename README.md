# Optical character recognition
This project is based on Optical character recognition , it recognize an image consisting of an alphabet. Ex: If input image consist of ‘A’ then the output of program is ‘A’ Character recognition enhances the processing of scanned images by allowing you to automatically recognize and extract text content from different data fields. For example, when you scan a form and use document imaging software to process it, OCR allows you to transfer information directly from the document to an electronic database.

you will have to create the database of images consisting of 55 images of each alphabet, Using "createdatabase()" function in program.
